# Hello Flask

A minimal Flask application demonstrating the basics of Python web development in a Nix-based environment.

## Setup

This project is configured using a `.idx/dev.nix` file, which automatically installs all necessary packages like Python and Flask. There is no need to create a virtual environment or install dependencies manually. The environment is ready to go as soon as the workspace starts.

## Usage

This IDE automatically runs the Flask application for you on startup.

To view the running application, open the **Previews** tab (usually found in the right-hand sidebar) and click on the "web" preview. A new panel will open inside the IDE showing your application.
